# DSA Questions 

## Why this repository?
I am trying to solve [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems because everybody has to do that (¬_¬ ). In this repository, I and maybe you (if you want to contribute, but why?) upload the solutions here for future reference, but most importantly, this gives me confidence ＼（〇_ｏ）／.

## Where to find solutions?
There are two ways to access the solution:

The first way is to see solutions according to the topic; each topic has a separate Markdown file. Each problem is separated by topic and difficulty level and contains a link to that problem and a solution link.
The second way is to see solutions according to the order in which I solved the questions. Open [OneForAll.md](https://github.com/31Sanskrati/DSA_Questions/blob/changes/OneforAll.md). Each problem has a topic, a link to another problem, a link to my solution, and the difficulty of the question.

## What you can do with this repository?
If you want to contribute and share your solutions. Just fork this repo, add your solutions, and open a pull request.
You can also solve the same questions as me. All these questions are very important for interviews and will help you a lot.

*If you need any help, feel free to contact me. I have nothing else to do, so dont hesitate ^_^.*
